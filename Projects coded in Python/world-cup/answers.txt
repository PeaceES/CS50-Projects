Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Simulations where the value of N is 100000 and 1000000

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 or more.
